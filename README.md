# Website-blocker
The goal of the Website Blocker python project is to ban certain websites from being accessed from any device. This project will assist the user in avoiding distractions by preventing them from accessing web pages on their smartphone.

The user may input numerous websites to block in this Python Website Blocker Project, and then hitting the block button will verify the condition that if the website has already been banned, it will print 'already blocked', else it will block all of the websites and print 'blocked'.
